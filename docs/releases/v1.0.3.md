### Download

**One File approach** (simple single file, more false-positive AV flags): Download `WoosNwnParser.exe` below and run it.

**One Directory approach** (directory with many files, less false-positive AV flags): Download `WoosNwnParser.zip` below, extract everything to a directory, and run `WoosNwnParser.exe`.

**Windows Security Notice**: Windows may show a SmartScreen warning because this is a new application. Click "More info" → "Run anyway" to proceed. This is normal for new, unsigned applications.

### Security Scan

**One File approach**: VirusTotal: [1/71 vendors flagged](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/927394e8bd322755921f06ec61c67f5f84e989633a3b5f8e2a3151476e639dd5)

These are false positives common with unsigned Python executables. The detections are generic ML-based flags, not specific malware signatures. Source code is available for inspection.

### Features

### Changelog

### Changed
- **Global mode** now uses the last damage timestamp instead of continuously ticking with current time
  - Both "Global" and "Per Character" modes now use the same last timestamp (most recent damage by any character)
  - The only difference between modes is the start time: Global uses the earliest damage event, Per Character uses each character's first damage event
- Renamed "Time Tracking" label to "First Timestamp" for better clarity
- Renamed "By Character" option to "Per Character" for more accurate grammar

### Fixed
- Reverted DPS panel refreshing every 1 second when in "Global" mode (no longer needed)
- Reverted DPS tracking "Per Character" taking `last timestamp` per character (optimal behavior is to track only first timestamp)
